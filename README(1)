Code intended to implement a classification model in order to determine how each of the Temer's speeches would be classified: as a Dilma's speech or as a Lula's speech. In other words, using Temer and Dilma speeches as the training set, how a new example (a single Temer speech) would be classified? As a Dilma or a Temer speech? This could be seen as a measure of similarity between speeches. 

(Speeches extracted by me from Itamaraty (ministry of foreign affairs of Brazil) website. See https://github.com/lasleandro/brazilian_presidents_speeches for the code)
